# namlemonade.neocities.org

Source code for my Neocities website, namlemonade.neocities.org

This is mostly for me to have somewhere to dump it before uploading it to Neocities, but also to track progress on it. Because it's nice yk!
Or maybe if you want to snoop in my code too. If you're into that. :)
