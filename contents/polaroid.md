						<p>Polaroid, or Polly, started put as a random villager I made myself on the
							browser
							game Furvilla on July 8th 2016. I eventually remember recoloring the base on
							my own
							time, but never submitted it as a paintie. In around 2018, I picked them up
							and
							decided to use them as a fursona. My old fursona, Sasha, a pink orca girl,
							just
							didn't feel fully "me" anymore. I was going through a gender crisis at the
							time.
							Despite identifying as nonbinary for years, I still felt disconnect with how
							I
							presented myself.</p>
						<p>Polaroid felt like the perfect thing to at least use while I make something
							better.
							At least that was the idea at first. I'm pretty sure they were just a
							placeholder
							until I designed something that felt truly me. But in the process, found
							myself in
							them.</p>
						<p>On August 11th 2023, I received my fursuit I ordered from the lovely Spice's
							Cauldron. After years of thinking, "One day, i'll have one of Polly too", it
							happened, and I couldn't be happier with it. They come with magnetic
							eyelids, magnetic antlers as well as magnetic fangs, to mimic a water deer!
						</p>
						<p>Fursuits are absolutely not necessary to be part of the fandom, but for me,
							it was something I wanted for myself. To connect with this unlikely fursona
							I picked for myself after falling out with my old one.</p>
