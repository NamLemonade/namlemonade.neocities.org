    					<p>Rose (full name Rose Carter, previously Reef) is my new fursona. I've been a deer for so long, and I wanted some changes. I've loved dolphins for a long time, but with the change in how people view them and the comments people made, I wouldn't really talk about it. My previous fursona before Polaroid was an orca, and this year, I wanted to go back to those roots.</p>
    					<p>There are many inspirations for this character. I'll just list them all!</p>
    					<ul>
    						<li><strong>Mr. Dolphin, May's dolphin friend in Guilty Gear</strong>. It was my primary inspiration, it reminded me of how much I love dolphins.</li>
    						<li><strong>Those dolphin memes to the Zara Larson song <em>"Symphony"</em></strong>. They made me laugh, and, again, reminded me of how much I love dolphins.</li>
    						<li><strong>Jones, the dolphin from Johnny Mnemonic</strong>. A movie from early in Keanu Reeves' career. The animatronic for that thing hit something in my brain. This is partially why Rose has robotic parts.</li>
    						<li><strong>The mascot for the Flipper Zero</strong>. He's so cute. And he kinda feels also inspired by Jones. So it kind of fit. The main inspiration for the screen on their arm.</li>
    						<li><strong>The general trope of dolphins in science fiction</strong>. There was a time where there was a lot more dolphins in science fiction. Societies of intelligent dolphins, genetically/cybernetically enhanced dolphins... That stuff fascinates me. There's probably a dolphin that matches this description that may or may not be from science fiction popping up in your head (people have told me about Discworld, Johnny Mnemonic and even that dolphin from the Spongebob movie)</li>
    						<li><strong>Ecco the dolphin</strong>. It feels obvious... But I always loved and was fascinated by Ecco. And this was a partial influence for my new fursona.</li>
    					</ul>

    					<p>They are still brand new. so there's not a lot of art of them yet, and there's no fursuit either (yet..?). But you can still check out their <a href="https://toyhou.se/30813726.rose-carter" target="_blank">Toyhouse</a> for more art of them!</p>
