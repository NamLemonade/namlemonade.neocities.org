				<h1>WPlace creations</h1>
				<p><i>Last updated: August 8th 2025</i></p>
				<p>My creations on <a href="https://wplace.live" target="_blank">wplace.live</a>! I might also include
					those I collabed on. They're in order of most recent to most ancient.</p>
				<p>I mostly work in the Québec City area. But I've gone to Montréal a few times, and lent a hand in
					Orlando, FL. If you want me to help you on your projects, let me know!</p>
