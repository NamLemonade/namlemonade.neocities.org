<p>I'm not sure how to get this started. I guess I'm just gonna go with the flow. It's about 21:33. I'm listening to Cowboy Carter by the ever-so talented Beyoncé, I'm coding the Blog area, and I've added pages that were missing. I'm also watching the Combo Breaker 2025 pool for Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Before this, I was trying to add stuff to my Backloggd, a website that acts kind of like Letterboxd but for video games, when it crashed. And I figured, why not finish this place up a little while it comes back online? It's been a while since it came back online, and I'm still here.</p>
<p>It's about time I clear up all those links that led to nowhere too. I bet this was really annoying to navigate.</p>
<p>I feel bad for not updating the website all that often. Especially the Flight Rising breeding tool. I feel like I should be better with it, but I'm unfortunately not. I've been so busy with work and everything. I feel too tired to code for myself. Everyone at work is getting laid off or put on unemployment because we "don't have a lot of clients moving forward with projects", and yet my schedule is still overflowing. Because I'm the only fullstack.</p>
<p>I've been so overworked that my wrists started hurting again. After it had been improving. I'm mad, but what can I do. I'll just keep taping and stretching, and if I gotta slow down, it'll be my work's problem.</p>
<p>Enough depressing work shit. Here's something I've been happy about. For the past few weeks, I've been living on what I call <strong><em>Beyoncé time</em></strong>.</p>

		<p>Beyoncé Time is when Beyoncé is on tour, and my feeds are full of clips of it. I know the dates, i know what happens, the dramas, mishaps and beautiful moments. It feels like everthing in my life is going according to Beyoncé tour days. <em>Maybe because I keep trying to catch those instagram lives that streams her shows since I can't attend, but you knowwww... :P</em></p>
		<p>Beyoncé tours are crazy. The quality of her shows is genuinely insane. Have you ever seen clips of her Renaissance tour? Have you seen clips of the Cowboy Carter tour? You should look into it! There is so much going on. She rides a mechanical bull at some point. She gets on a huge truck too. And she flies away on a horseshoe as she sings her cover of <em>Jolene</em>.</p>
		<p>I saw clips of the Renaissance tour, and it converted me into a Beyhive. I'm a little old to start getting into celebrities I guess, but whatever, it's fun. And the Beyhive is full of people kind enough to share clips and livestream the show. Hell they film so much, you can see anything that happens in there. I got to see three different POVs of 2 guys fighting in the pit as she sang <em>II HANDS II HEAVEN</em> LOL.</p>
		<p>You should really listen to Cowboy Carter. Such a beautiful country album. And if that's not your style, give Renaissance a shot. It's a house record full of tributes to black queer culture.</p>

<p>I don't know. Talking about Beyoncé makes me happy. I'm probably not gonna read that back before posting. Whatever. Listen to Bey, she's so good.</p>
<p>Oh yeah also, I totally experienced a fursona shift and started also maining a Dolphin fursona. I probably won't change the website's layout to one themed after my dolphin sona. OR i might do something that lets you shift the theme between the Polly and the Dolphin one. Ideas ideas...</p>
<p>I can't promise I'll make those entries regular. But I'll write them sometimes, to update people who check my website.</p>
<p>I gotta put this online now, so have a nice weekend, see ya :)</p>
