<p>Updating my blog again... Hello! Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've updated this place. Which is, sort of to be expected. I don't exactly think about
	creating blog entries weekly. If I want to post immediate life updates, I'd rather go on my private Twitter account
	for the 4 people that care about what I have to say at that very second haha. But, here's a few life updates.</p>

<p>Last update, my wrists were pretty bad. Like really bad. I was considering going back to the physiotherapist. But
	I've been doing a lot better. Like a lot better. I've sstoned down certain activities, and I've taken a 1 week
	vacation from work where I didn't really rest, but nevertheless. It helped a lot.</p>

<p>I was also in a bad work phase at work. And it had been lasting for a long time. Thankfully, I had a talk with my
	boss and I've been having a better time. Less work on my desk and stuff like that. I've been feeling less stressed.
	So much so that I started to draw again! For Artfight, which was last month. But still! That's huge, I haven't been
	inspired to draw for so long..!</p>

<hr />

<p>Outside of Life stuff, during my vacations, I attended the Montreal part of Tyler the Creator's Chromakopia World
	Tour.</p>

<p>Montréal is a bit of a Distance from where I live. So I split my travel days. It was the first time I took the train
	too, with Via Rail. And I'll say, I've been converted. Trains are so much fun. So much space compared to travel
	busses. So chill. </p>

    	<p>The lines were long, but going inside was smooth. The people of the Bell Center were doing an amazing job
    		directing people and moving the crowd. There was also a Golf (Tyler the Creator's clothing brand) shop
    		pop-up outside the Bell Center, selling tour merch for those who couldn't attend the show inside. Which I
    		think is very cool.</p>
    	<p>When it comes to merchandise, I only grabbed one thing. The black Chromakopia world tour varsity jacket. It
    		was the only thing I wanted. I also bought one for my sister. Expensive! But worth it. So gorgeous.</p>
    	<p>This was the first show he played since he had released his surprise album, Don't Tap The Glass, the day
    		before. That album is, SO good by the way. You should listen to it. It's kind of old school, fun music to
    		dance to. He meant it when he said "Body Movement, no sitting still".</p>
    	<p>He, unfortunately, did not play any of the songs. It's ok. I understand he wanted to keep it for other
    		places. It was still, a lot of fun. I've never heard a crowd so invested. Singing along. So loud. Couple
    		that with the fact that Montreal crowds are already insane as is...</p>

<p>At the start of the show, Tyler, who honestly might have been a little tired considering he's been touring
	for months, said something along the lines of, the show had barely started, and the energy was already
	better than the one at his past 4 shows (which were all in NY... So sorry New York)</p>

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-12 col-lg-7">
		<p>This show meant a lot to me. I've been a fan of Tyler for a while. I'm not gonna pretend I'm an oldhead
			fan
			though. But I found out about him a while ago, and I wanted to see him live. I wanted to sing along to
			EARFQUAKE, NEW MAGIC WAND and ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?. Hear song from my favorite album of his, Call Me If You
			Get Lost. And I did. And I'm
			not
			ashamed to say, I did start to cry during EARFQUAKE. It was such a raw moment. I also cried at Like Him.
			Again,
			such a raw moment. A crowd choir singing back at Tyler. Idk. It feels some type of way. Everyone knew
			what to
			do, without him telling us to.</p>

    	<p>I can't really listen to EARFQUAKE anymore without missing the show. This place I felt like home. People
    		in green, in GOLF merch, dressed up like Tyler's past eras, I've seen someone dressed up as Finn from
    		Adventure Time too. Someone with LEDs attached to their body, so it looked like a stickman was dancing.
    		Someone dressed up as Igor, standing under one single light at an emergency exit. Dancing. It felt
    		poetic. It felt good being surrounded by other superfans.</p>

<p>Now, this was past news. I want present stuff. What was I doing this week... Well I'll tell you.</p>
<p><i>Have you heard of <a href="https://wplace.live" target="_blank">wplace.live</a></i>...</p>
<p>It's like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place" target="_blank">r/place</a>, except on the scale of the
	entire world. The world is your canvas. Put your mark, complement others. I love going on there and seeing what
	people are making.</p>
<p>I heard of it early this week. It blew up on thursday on Twitter, but I found out about it a little earlier. Through
	the DELTARUNE fandom. I decided I wanted to contribute, leave my mark. I've hovered around Québec City and Montreal,
	sometimes going out further to help or spread some Stuff. Spread my message, or something.</p>
<p>I've done a lot of DELTARUNE stuff, like many, because that's all my brain can process right now. But I'm spreading
	my wings and doing other things.</p>
