				<h3 class="mt-5">People</h3>
				<p><strong>Gao</strong>, for always being here to check my website whenever I push to
					prod, and here to listen to me bitch about code while I'm at work. Idk where i'd be
					without you ❤️</p>
				<p><strong>Ame / Bug</strong>, for sticking with me thru all those years. You've seen me
					change career paths, you've seen me at my worst and at my best. You're my best
					friend, and I wouldn't trade you for the world.</p>
				<p><strong>My furry friends</strong>, for all the fun times we've had together, the
					support you've given me and all the times you've joined me on VRChat to hear me talk
					about random shit or watch random stuff like Jackass or Captain Laserhawk. Look at
					us!</p>
				<p><strong>My mutuals on my private twitter</strong>, for indulging in my antics and
					going along with whatever I decide to go on about.</p>
				<p><strong>My brother from another mother Benji</strong>, for sticking with me for so long and introducing me to your other friends, whom I yap endlessly to. Passing around Tenna like a blunt has never been so fun.</p>
				<p><strong>Everyone from the Leonyusha server</strong>, for listening to me yap about Beyoncé and sitting thru the same gif over and over again. Y'all are so cool</p>
				<p><strong>Kevin202</strong>, for also sticking with me through the years even when I dropped completely out of Taiko. You're a good friend, and even though I'm quick to joke at your expense sometimes, know that I wouldn't trade ya for the world. You're my boy.</p>
				<p><strong>JayminTaiko</strong>. I've only known you for a few months so far, but I could tell from the first time we properly met that we'd get along. You're a genuine guy, but also your energy clashes with mine in the best ways. The Minecraft divorce was funny as hell. Can't wait to build more memories with you man <em>*fistbump*</em></p>

    			<p><strong>You</strong>, for being here right now and checking out my website!</p>
