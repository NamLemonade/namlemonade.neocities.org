    			<p>I've always been fascinated with the concept of "The Computer". You mean to tell me I
    				can talk to my friends with this thing, AND I can play games? I never really thought
    				of becoming a programmer, it was something that arrived after I had to switch career
    				path. Now here I am, making websites for a living and making websites when I'm at
    				home!</p>
    			<p>Besides being a programmer, I'm also a furry. I draw art, buy art, try to attend
    				meets in my suit, stuff like that. I'm also a VR fur, one of those people with an
    				expensive setup just to watch movies with friends haha!</p>
    			<p>And y'now, besides all of that, I draw as a hobby, and I play video games. I indulge
    				in things I like, I chat with friends, I ride my bike to pretty places... I live a
    				pretty relaxed life. I don't really aspire for adventure, just stability ❤️</p>
