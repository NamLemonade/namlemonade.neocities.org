summary: We got a custom domain! I'm feeling motivated to keep this website going haha! Besides that, I updated the home page text, added a chatbox, added the previous versions of the website to the sidebar, added a Spotify playlist, added a counter in the footer and a page for credits. I also did a 404 page. Other pages might come soon, maybe.
