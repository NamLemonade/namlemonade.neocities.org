summary: Major update here! Under the hood, I moved all my pure HTML code into Eleventy templates, and dear god I should've done this sooner hahaha. But for the audience, I have added a BRAND NEW THEME! Featuring my other fursona, Reef Cyberdolphin! I hope you enjoy it! If you come here again after a while, it should give you a theme at random. However, you can switch it by clicking the button in the footer :)
