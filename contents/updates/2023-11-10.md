summary: 1. I've been informed (found out myself) that Polaroid was stretched like crazy on iPad. That has been fixed. Also took the time to fix some horizontal overflow on smaller screens. I'll get around to work on this again I promise! 2. Second update for today... Made myself a brand new button! Feel free to add it to your websites! I also edited some stuff, fixed typos, added further credits, changed the pic in my about, etc...
