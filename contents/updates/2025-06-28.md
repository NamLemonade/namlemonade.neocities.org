summary: Small stuff for today. I did some mild adjustments to make the website work even if the theme toggle fails. I also added a special cursor to the sea theme :). Added some new names to the now-renamed "Credits and special thanks" page. I also gave Reef their own page on the website, accessible from Polaroid's page or directly from the Sea theme. I removed the page for my art, I gave up on hosting it there. Instead, I will replace it by a shrine page whenever I get around to that. Hope you have a wonderful weekend y'all!
